### Project Idea
#### Background Info
For this year's freedom project, my friends and I have come together to decide to create a multipart game using inspiration from the games we play on our free time. The synopsis of our game is based on the Japanese "gachapon" or gacha system of obtaining items, characters, or other game components through chance. Many famous games use this gacha system as a method of inticing players and as a mechanique for players to obtain new items, some widely known gacha games are; Genshin Impact, Honkai Impact 3rd, Honkai Star Rail, Project Sekai, Onmyoji, Arknights, Wuthering Waves, and many more in many different styles. 

These games often have a risk/reward exchange where players exchange the in-game currency to "pull" or "roll" for a certain character (most often of the highest rarity), where the reward would be obtaining the desired character and the risk is losing against the system and not obtaining the desired item. There is a fixed chance of obtaining different rarities ranging from rare (R), super rare (SR), to super super rare (SSR) with the probability decreasing as rarity increases. Once the user reaches a certain number of pulls, they are guaranteed a random SSR character. Once the user obtains a SSR character, the number of pulls reset back to zero. This will all be essential to this section of the game.



#### Big Idea
The main idea of this project is to combine two separate game functions together into one game. Part A will be where the user nevigates the avatar, a cat, around a 2D plain to collect the game's currency, cat food, with the help of a variety of boosts to assisst the user. The cat food will randomly spawn around the map and the user will have to quickly run around the map avoiding obstacles and hindrances to collect them. The obstacles may consist of puddles of water that the player has to go around, or dogs that will end the round. The boosts can be cat toys that increase the speed of the user for a temporary amount of time, and catnip that can extend the time limit.
