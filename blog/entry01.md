### Project Idea
##### Background Info
For this year's freedom project, my friends and I have come together to decide to create a multipart game using inspiration from the games we play on our free time. The synopsis of our game is based on the Japanese "gachapon" or gacha system of obtaining items, characters, or other game components through chance. Many famous games use this gacha system as a method of inticing players and as a mechanique for players to obtain new items, some widely known gacha games are; Genshin Impact, Honkai Impact 3rd, Honkai Star Rail, Project Sekai, Onmyoji, Arknights, Wuthering Waves, and many more. 

These games often have a risk/reward exchange where players exchange the in-game currency to "pull" or "roll" for a certain character (most often of the highest rarity), where the reward would be obtaining the desired character and the risk is loosing against the system and not obtaining the desired item. There is a fixed chance of obtaining different rarities ranging from common, rare, to super rare, and higher.

A vital part in this system is the Pity system that garauntees the user obtains a random Super Rare item after the user hits hard pity after a certain number of pulls. Once the user reaches hard pity the chances of obtaining a Super Rare increases to 100%. Hard pity varies from game to game and can vary from 60, 90, or more pulls.
