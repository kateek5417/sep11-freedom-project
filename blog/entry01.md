### Project Idea
##### Background Info
For this year's freedom project, my friends and I have come together to decide to create a multipart game using inspiration from the games we play on our free time. The synopsis of our game is based on the Japanese "gachapon" or gacha system of obtaining items, characters, or other game components through chance. Many famous games use this gacha system as a method of inticing players and as a mechanique for players to obtain new items, some widely known gacha games are; Genshin Impact, Honkai Impact 3rd, Honkai Star Rail, Project Sekai, Onmyoji, Arknights, Wuthering Waves, and many more in many different styles. 

These games often have a risk/reward exchange where players exchange the in-game currency to "pull" or "roll" for a certain character (most often of the highest rarity), where the reward would be obtaining the desired character and the risk is losing against the system and not obtaining the desired item. There is a fixed chance of obtaining different rarities ranging from rare (R), super rare (SR), to super super rare (SSR) with the probability decreasing as rarity increases. Once the user reaches a certain number of pulls, they are guaranteed a random SSR character. Once the user obtains a SSR character, the number of pulls reset back to zero. This will all be essential to this section of the game.
