### Content
For the past few months I have been learning the tool [p5play](https://p5play.org/) to help me buld my Freedom Project at the end of the year. The component that I've worked on the most are `Sprites` and more recently user inputs because they make up a large portion of the game function. The first thing I did was to create a `tinker.html` file in my IDE and copied-pasted the code links into the file so that I could try out code as I learn and use other sources to guide me. To start me off with something simple I looked up tutorials for sprites and found this [video introducing p5play and basic sprite functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ23FHfgA0A&t=1770s).
