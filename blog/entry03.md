### Content

For my winter break goal I _said_ that I would finish up some of the sprites for the game. It comes to no ones suprise that I infact did not finish drawing _all_ of the sprites. In the game we are making we need a lot of sprites, especially considering the fact that our game focuses on collecting different characters. Between pure procrastination, lack of motivation, art block, and doing other non-productive things, I was only able to complete one or two of the sprites.

I am aware that my lack of productivity is a big setback in our group's progress and I will have to pick up on the things I have missed. This time, instead of trying to force myself through unbearable hours of art frustration to complete 5+ sprites in a week, I will try to slowly complete one sprite a week. I can work on line art one day, base coloring the next, and some patterns details afterwards.

Here is a sneekpeek at some of the many sprites for the game:

The last part I left off at in my IDE was Creating random colored box sprites with the push of a button. The next thing I intend to do with p5play is to figure out how to delete the box sprite and create another sprite in place of the removed sprite at the same time. I will try to do this with the `.remove` mechanism exampled [here](https://p5play.org/learn/group.html?page=2). Then I will have to figure out how to make it seem like the sprite was dispensed by a machine (will probably also be a sprite).

### Skills

One skill that i practiced while making the sprites is creativity. My group thought of a list of funny cat concepts and when it was time to draw the sprite I had the creative freedom to make them as silly as I wanted to. I also had to be creative with the coloring so that there wouldn't be too many similarly colored cats.

A skill that I should improve on is time management because my procrastination and poor goal setting is why I didn't make as much progress as i had hoped. That is why instead of setting a goal of completing the sprites in one week, I will set a goal to gradually work on them overtime so that I don't become overwhelmed with the amount I have to create.

### EDP
I am still in the researching phase of learning `p5play` and its multitude of codes. As I continue to learn more about the different possibilities, I am also thinking about which parts I can use to create the final project.
