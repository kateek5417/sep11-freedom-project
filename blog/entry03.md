For my winter break goal I _said_ that I would finish up some of the sprites for the game. It comes to no ones suprise that I infact did not finish drawing _all_ of the sprites. In the game we are making we need a lot of sprites, especially considering the fact that our game focuses on collecting different characters. Between pure procrastination, lack of motivation, art block, and doing other non-productive things, I was only able to complete one or two of the sprites.

I am aware that my lack of productivity is a big setback in our group's progress and I will have to pick up on the things I have missed. This time, instead of trying to force myself through unbearable hours of art frustration to complete 5+ sprites in a week, I will try to slowly complete one sprite a week.
