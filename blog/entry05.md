### Content
As the project comes to a close, me and my partner combined our different parts of our project into one. For the bulk of the process my partner focused on creating the animated background while I focused on the random generation portion of the game. Over spring break my group organized a day to come together to finalize our game by combining and touching up and any works. For our game, my partner and I used [p5play](https://p5play.org/) to create the backgrounds and the sprites while my partners for the other game segment used [kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) to create their mini-game. 

### Skills
Two skills I used were collaboration and communication. Throughout the making of this project I've had to communicate with my partners on working details of different parts of the project as well as designating tasks, asking for help, and brainstorming new ideas. As I worked I would also consult with my collaborators on how the product could be improved upon and what things could be added..

### EDP
At this poin of the engineering design process we have finished the MVP of our project and are now working on adding on extra things to improve certain aspects. Additionally we still need to find a way to share data from both games with each other. The next step would be communicating our results with everybody else.
