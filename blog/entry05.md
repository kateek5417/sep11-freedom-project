As the project comes to a close, me and my partner combined our different parts of our project into one. My partner worked on the background and its animations while I worked on the random generation of the cats. We got together one day over spring break to finalize everything. Both me and my partner used [p5play](https://p5play.org/) to create the backgrounds and the sprites.
