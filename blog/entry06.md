# Entry 6
##### 6/2/25

### Content
After we finished up our products, we then had to present it to our class and then give an elevator pitch in the Expo infront of judges. To prepare for them, my partner and I created a presentation slide show for our class and drafted a simple script for our pitch.

#### In class
Takeaways I got from the in-class presentation is the importance of strong eye contact and the way one projects their voice. Keeping good eye contact with the audience helps maintain engagement and attention. Additionally, it also improves the audience's perspective of one's knowledge on their presentation as people can tell when someone reads off the board compared to someone who really knows what they are presenting.
