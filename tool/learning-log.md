#### Intro to P5Play
* P5 is a code library that has a multitude of precoded objects and functions coded in JavaScript that is then used to build our own code, p5play is an addition that adds more to it
* I watched an [Intro to p5play - Sprites](https://youtu.be/ZQ23FHfgA0A?si=oRWzUChn_Sgg8_Po) video to follow along with and understand the concept of p5play better
* Using `windowWidth` and `windowHeight` when creating a new canvas will make it so the canvas fits the size of the window. Ex: `new Canvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);`
    * Can also create an aspet ratio for the canvas instead of setting specific dimensions. Ex: `new Canvas("1:1");`
* I tinkered around with all most of the different attributes to change the shape and appearance of the sprite and discovered that the smaller the y-axis value, the higher the sprite goes.
