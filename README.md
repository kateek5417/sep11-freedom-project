# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Katee Ko**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study **p5play** in order to help me make a gacha game. The term "gacha" derpives from the Japanese gachapon vending machines where users insert currency to obtain random rewards. My game functions in a similar manner where users will spend cat food to obtain random cats of varying rarities from rare to super-super-rare, increasing in difficulty of obtaining. In each rarity, there are a multitude of original hand-drawn cat sprites, each with different designs.
